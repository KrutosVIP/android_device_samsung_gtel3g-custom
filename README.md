##Building instructions

### What do you need?
* 50GB left of your hard disk space
* Basic skills / knowledge of Linux

### Building steps
* 1. Sync Android source
* 2. Copy this file ([core33g.xml](https://github.com/koquantam/android_local_manifests/blob/cm-14.1-core33g/core33g.xml)) to `.repo/local_manifests` (if that folder doesn't exist then "mkdir" it)
* 3. `repo sync` again
* 4. After syncing source and device-specific repo (from step 2), from your source root folder (where you have synced) open Terminal, `cd` to device/samsung/scx30g-common, type `./patch.sh` (this is the quick patching script)
* 5. `cd` to your source root again, type `. build/envsetup.sh && brunch core33g`
